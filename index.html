								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<p>When I'm not busy doing school/research/job/club work, I keep myself occupied by working <br /> on  my various interests.
								</p>
							</header>


							
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-dove">
									<h3>Eagles</h3>
									<p>Eagles are amazing. Eagles love the storm. When clouds gather, the eagles get excited. The eagle uses the storm’s wind to lift itself higher. Once it finds the wind of the storm, the eagles uses the raging storm to lift itself above the clouds. This gives the eagle an opportunity to glide and rest its wings. In the meantime, all the other birds hide in the leaves and branches of the trees.
										We can use the storms of life to rise to greater heights. <i> Achievers relish challenges and use them profitably.</i>
										Eagles have strong vision, which focuses up to 5 kilometers from the air. When an eagle sites prey- even a rodent from this distance, it narrows its focus on it and sets out to get it. No matter the obstacle, the eagle will not move its focus from the prey until it grabs it. <i>Have a vision and remain focused no matter what the obstacle and you will succeed</i>.</p>

									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3>Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
									<p>Machine learning is growing in importance due to increasingly enormous volumes and variety of data, the access and affordability of computational power, and the availability of high speed Internet.With greater access to data and computation power, machine learning is becoming more ubiquitous every day and will soon be integrated into many facets of human life. Currently, I am working on project that tries to predict the overall worldwide box office revenue of movies using data such as the movie cast, crew, posters, plot keywords, budget, production companies, release dates, languages, and countries.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>Programming is a skill that I always wanted to have but was too intimidated to start working on. However, that all changed last year and now that I have finally got started - programming is a skill that I am developing in my free time. I primarily use YouTube and the plethora of online resources available to learn and practice. My go-to IDE of choice is Visual Studio, however I am trying to be a Vim master. Also, spaces &gt tabs.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-infinity">
									<h3>Mathematics and Mathematicians</h3>
									<p>As evident by my life choices, math truly is one of my biggest passions. It is the purest way of viewing the world, and it is this very lens that I am trying to polish to get a better understanding of reality. In my free time, I love watching 3Blue1Brown videos, working on sample math problems, and learning about great Mathematicians of the past. Being an aspiring mathematician, I am very inspired by the work of Emmy Noether and talk about her to my friends/family on every occasion that I get.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-palette">
									<h3>Arts and Artifacts</h3>
									<p>Art has always been an integral part of my life. My father is an artist and an art teacher so I was raised to see the world through a creative lens. I grew up in awe with the works of M. C. Escher, Gustav Klimt, and Caravaggio. As I got older, I realized my affinity to the sciences but my love for the arts didn’t dwindle. Instead, now, I see Mathematics and Art as one in the same. Math, I would say, is just my favorite type of art.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-bullseye">
									<h3>Outreach</h3>
									<p>I truly believe it is up to us to inspire and encourage scientific curiosity within the community. I love chatting to anyone about ideas and the wonders of science. When we aren’t in a global pandemic I love attending conferences and volunteering at community events to help people see why Math and Physics are so important, interesting and, best of all, fun!</p>
								</li>

								
								<li class="icon solid fa-paper-plane">
									<h3>Food and Travelling</h3>
									<p>Some of the most rewarding experiences I have had in life have come through the opportunity to travel. I feel incredibly grateful that I have had the opportunity to explore countries like Italy, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, and Sweden. Though it isn’t as common anymore, Pinterest is great for feeding my daydreams to explore the world and all it has to offer.
									</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-icons">
									<h3>Social Dynamics</h3>
									<p>I love to understand and analyze social situations. I find the rich interactions between humans absolutely amazing - starting from their body language to their use of language. Looking at social situations as information channels has allowed me to better understand my friends and family and also develop a higher EQ. It is a hobby that has paid its divident as I am always the person to diffuse conflicts in a friend group whenever it arises.</p>

								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-graduation-cap">
									<h3>Teaching</h3>
									<p>I was always passionate about learning which transcended more and more into teaching as I grew up. My experiences in teaching Math to 7th graders when I was in high school, STEM and college readiness classes to middle and high schoolers last summer, and more recently being a peer tutor to students with learning disabilities in college serve as constant reminders as how fulfilling teaching is for me.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-glasses">
									<h3>Reading</h3>
									<p>Sadly I can't say that I am able to read as much as I want to, however, every now and then I pick up a book and finish it in a weekend. My favorite book often changes, as there is a different book for every occasion, but if I had to choose something I would choose What if? by Randall Munroe. Currently I am enjoying The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Lui. If you happen to have any suggestions I’d be happy to hear them!</p>
