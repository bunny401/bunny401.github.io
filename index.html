								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<p>I enthusiastically engage in school, research, job, and club activities, all while dedicating time to nurture my diverse interests.
								</p>
							</header>


							
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-dove">
									<h3>Alice in Wonderland</h3>
									<p>Infused with my deep affection for 'Alice in Wonderland,' this captivating movie has woven its enchantment into every facet of my life. As an avid viewer, 
										I've discovered more than just a whimsical tale – it's become my refuge, especially during times of stress. In the realms of academia and research, 
										much like Alice, I explore the uncharted territories of hypotheses and knowledge. Guided by the Cheshire Cat's timeless wisdom – 'We're all mad here' – I embrace the unique 
										and imaginative, channeling these traits into my academic pursuits. This film is my constant companion, 
										a testament to the power of curiosity and imagination to unlock incredible possibilities in both the cinematic wonderland and the world of academia.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-cubes">
									<h3>Research</h3>
									<p>In the enchanting wonderland of academic research, I often find myself 
										akin to Alice, traversing the intricate rabbit holes of knowledge. Much like her 
										curious journey, my exploration involves unlocking doors to uncharted realms, where each thesis
										 and experiment serves as a magical key. The academic landscape, at times whimsical and unpredictable, 
										 mirrors Wonderland's curious inhabitants—diverse minds engaged in a dance of intellectual discovery. 
										 Just as Alice encountered peculiar challenges and riddles, so do I confront complex problems that require 
										 creative solutions. In this academic Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat's grin manifests as the elusive insight 
										 that appears when least expected, guiding me through the maze of theoretical puzzles. As I navigate this captivating academic adventure,
										 I am reminded that, like Alice, the joy lies not just in 
										 reaching the destination but in the wonderment of the journey itself.
										</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>Programming is a skill that I always wanted to have 
										but was too intimidated to start working on. 
										However, that all changed when I started High School and 
										that I finally got started - programming is a skill that I am developing every time.
										I primarily use YouTube and the plethora of online resources available to learn and practice.
										My go-to IDE of choice is Visual Studio, however I am trying to be a Vim master. 
										Also, spaces &gt tabs.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-infinity">
									<h3>Security</h3>
									<p> In the world of computers and the internet, I'm like a digital superhero, 
										but instead of a cape, I wear the armor of network security. Imagine it as the
										 invisible shield that keeps your online life safe and sound. I got hooked on 
										 this stuff because it's like being a high-tech detective, always on the lookout 
										 for sneaky hackers trying to mess with our digital world. I love the challenge of 
										 figuring out how to lock the virtual doors and windows so that our information stays private and our online playground
										 stays fun. It's like being a guardian of the internet, and I'm on a mission to make sure the bad guys don't stand a chance!</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-palette">
									<h3>Arts and Artifacts</h3>
									<p>Art has always been an integral part of my life. I was raised to see the world through a creative lens.
										I grew up in awe with the works of M. C. Escher, Gustav Klimt, and Caravaggio. 
										As I got older, I realized my affinity to the sciences but my love for the arts didn’t dwindle.
										Instead, now, I see Programming and Art as one in the same. Coding, I would say, is just my favorite type of art.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-bullseye">
									<h3>Outreach</h3>
									<p>I hold a strong conviction that fostering and igniting scientific curiosity within our community rests within our hands. Engaging 
										in conversations about ideas and the marvels of science brings me immense joy. When circumstances permit, I eagerly participate in conferences 
										and contribute as a volunteer at community events, aiming to illuminate the significance, intrigue, and sheer enjoyment inherent in Computer Science skills.</p>
								</li>

								
								<li class="icon solid fa-paper-plane">
									<h3>Food and Travelling</h3>
									<p>I treasure the most enriching moments of my life, many of which have blossomed from the privilege of traveling. 
										I hold immense gratitude for having had the chance to immerse myself in the cultures of captivating countries such as Italy, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, 
										and Switzerland. While the avenues for travel have shifted, platforms 
										like Pinterest continue to fuel my aspirations of exploring the world's vast treasures, igniting my daydreams of boundless adventure and discovery.
									</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-icons">
									<h3>Social Dynamics</h3>
									<p>I love to understand and analyze social situations. 
									   I find the rich interactions between humans absolutely amazing - starting from their body
									    language to their use of language. Looking at social situations as information channels has 
										allowed me to better understand my friends and family and also develop a higher EQ. 
										It is a hobby that has paid its divident as I am always the person to diffuse conflicts in a 
										friend group whenever it arises.</p>

								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-graduation-cap">
									<h3>Teaching</h3>
									<p>

										I have always been passionate about learning, and this passion has increasingly extended to teaching as I've grown. 
										My experiences include teaching Math to 7th graders during high school, leading STEM and college readiness classes for middle and high school students in past summers, 
										and, more formerly, serving as a peer tutor for college students with learning disabilities. 
										These experiences continually remind me of how fulfilling teaching is for me.</p>
								</li>

								<li class="icon solid fa-glasses">
									<h3>Reading</h3>
									<p>Sadly I can't say that I am able to read as much as I want to, 
										however, every now and then I pick up a book and finish it in a weekend. 
										My favorite book often changes, as there is a different book for every occasion, 
										but if I had to choose something I would choose What if? by Randall Munroe. 
										Currently I am enjoying The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Lui. 
										If you happen to have any suggestions I’d be happy to hear them!</p>
